//! The CSS animations an element owns, mirrored for the style stage.
//!
//! Reconciling an element's `CSSAnimation` objects against its freshly computed `animation-*`
//! longhands used to be a host call, because only the host could say which animations the element
//! already owned. The names of those animations are published here instead, so the style
//! computation decides the reconciliation from its own inputs and hands the host a plan.
//!
//! Only the names are mirrored: matching an animation is matching its name, and everything the
//! host does once a definition has found its animation - applying the timing, resolving the
//! keyframes, cancelling what no definition claimed - it does from the list it already holds.
